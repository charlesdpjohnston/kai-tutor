# KAI Guided Project: A Structured Learning System

Welcome to the KAI Guided Project! This repository is a unique, interactive learning environment designed for use with an AI-powered IDE like Cursor.

The system uses an AI tutor named KAI to teach you computer science fundamentals. It works by taking your passion project idea and helping you create a structured, phased version of it that guarantees you learn core concepts in a logical order.

## How It Works

1.  **Define Your Project:** Open `tutor_state/01_Project_Brief.md` and describe the project you're passionate about building.
2.  **Start Your Session:** Open this project in your AI IDE. Start a chat with the agent by giving it the full context of the repository. A good starting prompt is: "Please act as KAI. Let's plan my project."
3.  **Plan Together:** KAI will analyze your idea and the curriculum goals. It will then propose a structured, multi-phase project plan in `tutor_state/03_Project_Plan.md`.
4.  **Collaborate & Learn:** Once you agree on the plan, KAI will begin guiding you through Phase 1, creating code in the `project/` folder and updating your `tutor_state/` files to track your progress.

Happy learning!
