# Socratic Tutor V3: A Guided Project Learning System

Welcome to the Socratic Tutor! This repository is designed to be an interactive learning environment where an AI tutor (KAI) helps you build a project that is both inspiring to you and educationally sound.

## How It Works

1.  **Define Your Project:** Open `tutor_state/01_Project_Brief.md` and describe the project you're passionate about building.
2.  **Start Your Session:** Open this project in an AI-powered IDE like Cursor. Start a chat with the agent by giving it the full context of the repository. A good starting prompt is: "Please act as KAI. Let's plan my project."
3.  **Plan Together:** KAI will analyze your idea and the curriculum goals. It will then propose a structured, multi-phase project plan in `tutor_state/03_Project_Plan.md`. This plan will be a version of your idea that is designed to teach you computer science fundamentals in a logical order.
4.  **Collaborate & Learn:** Once you agree on the plan, KAI will begin guiding you through Phase 1, creating code in the `project/` folder and updating your `tutor_state/` files to track your progress.

Happy learning!
